We want to test the function retrieveTodosRelatedToSpring

Terminologies:
1. SUT (System Under Test) would be class TodoBusinessImpl
2. TodoService is the dependency

How to test this without actual implementation of TodoService (ie. actual data)

STUB:
1. Sample/Fake implementation of external dependency with preprogrammed return values
2. A typical stub is a database connection that allows you to mimic any scenario without having a real database.

Setups:
1. Create TodoServiceStub
2. Test TodoBusinessImpl using TodoServiceStub
3. Create TodoService instance using TodoServiceStub

Problems with Stub:
1. How to create different scenarios when using a Stub? ie. Dynamic Conditions
   for ex. Receive no values (nothing returned from TodoService), Or single value etc Or return depending on user
   Adding all this to the Stub class will make it grow fast and it will have complex logic in it which will be hard to maintain

2. We need to implement all the methods mentioned in the Original interface ie. TodoService otherwise TodoServiceStub wouldn't compile

So overall we have a lot of maintenance overhead

MOCK:
What is mocking?
Mocking is creating objects that simulate behaviour of real objects
Unlike stubs, mocks can be dynamically created from code - at runtime
Mocks offer more functionality than stubbing
You can verify method calls and a lot of other things

1. mock(ClassName.class)
2. Mockito mocks return default values when they are not stubbed
3. We have specify than when this function called with this argument return this
4. ex. when(todoServiceMock.retrieveTodos("Dummy")).thenReturn(List.of("Learn Spring MVC","Learn Spring","Learn to Dance"));
5. Can test different scenarios without much setup as we can modify the return value

Argument matchers:
1. anyInt() etc.
2. Throw exception-> thenThrow()

BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)
1. Write tests using
   Given
   When
   Then

2. ex
   Story: Product Returns go to Stock

   In order to keep track of stock, as a store owner I want to add items back to stock when they're returned.

   Scenario 1:
   Given that a customer previously bought a black sweater from me
   When he returns the black sweater for a refund
   Then I should have one more black sweater in stock

   Scenario 2:
   Given that a customer previously bought a blue garment from me
   When he returns blue garment for a replacement in black
   Then we would have one more blue garment and one less black garment in stock

3. Given - setup
   When - actual method call
   Then - asserts

4. BDD Mockito class
   given().willReturn()
   assertThat( actualValue , is(expectedValue) )


Verify Calls on Mock:

Check if a method is called or not, also how many times a method was called

given(listMock.get()).willReturn() , check whether listMock.get() called or not

verify(todoServiceMock).deleteTodo("Learn to Dance")-> verify that deleteTodo method called only with argument "Learn to Dance"

To check if method not called with given argument add never()
Check how many times method called times(2), check if called 2 times
atleastOnce() also present and other methods also present

Capture Arguments passed to a mock:
1. Declare argument captor for
2. Define argument captor on specific method call
3. Capture the argument
4. getAllValues() to check for multiple arguments

Hamcrest Matchers:
Add dependency, hamcrest core only contains basic stuff
